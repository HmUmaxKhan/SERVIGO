SERVIGO: SERVIGO is a comprehensive desktop application designed to connect users with various service providers such as doctors, plumbers, mechanics, laundry men, electricians, and cable operators. Our goal was to create a seamless experience for users seeking professional services, while also providing service providers with a convenient platform to manage their tasks.

Purpose: The purpose of SERVIGO is to bridge the gap between users and service providers, revolutionizing the way professional services are accessed and managed. We understand that finding reliable service providers can be a daunting task, and that's where SERVIGO comes in. By offering a user-friendly interface, advanced filtering options, and seamless task management, we aim to simplify the process of connecting users with the right service providers. Our application provides convenience, transparency, and efficiency, ensuring that users can easily access quality services while empowering service providers to showcase their skills and expertise. With SERVIGO, we envision a future where the process of seeking and providing professional services is streamlined and hassle-free.
